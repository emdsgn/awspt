  <p class="body">Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Thomas Letzel is an analytical chemist with almost 20 years of professional experience in the field of analytical screening techniques using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Prof. Letzel is head of the Analytical Research Group at the Chair of Urban Water Systems Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Currently, the key aspects in research cover technological, analytical-methological and analytical-chemical properties and can be applied in water and wastewater analysis as well as in other relevant environmental matrices, food analysis, beverage and plant extract analysis and others. New separation techniques like RPLC-HILIC-MS and SFC-MS allow the polarity extended separation and identification of organic molecules. A special focus is on the chemical analysis with simultaneous functionality analysis using mass spectrometric detection. He is author and co-author of more than 100 publications and two books. He has experience with many national and international research projects and he actively participates in international environmental initiatives like NORMAN Association and ESSEM COST Action ES1307. </p>
