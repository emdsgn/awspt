  <p class="body">Joan García (1966) is Professor of “environmental engineering” in the Civil Engineering School of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-BarcelonaTech, Spain. He is director of the “Research Group on Environmental Engineering and Microbiology” (www.gemma.upc). He obtained a degree in biology in 1990 and presented a doctoral dissertation on wastewater treatment engineering in 1996. Joan carries out interdisciplinary research on the development and improvement of environmental biotechnologies that mimicking nature and maximizing eco-efficiency allow treatment of wastewaters and other kinds of wastes. In particular research is currently conducted on systems for wastewater treatment and at the same time materials and energy recovery, like constructed wetlands and microalgae photobioreactors. These biotechnologies are becoming popular in the environmental sector to manage a wide range of polluted waters and wastes like urban and industrial wastewaters, landfill leachate, animal wastes, and sludges of organic origin.</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Selection of cyanobacteria grown in wastewater treatment systems for metabolites production</p>
