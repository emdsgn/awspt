  <p class="body">Joan García (1966) is Professor of “environmental engineering” in the Civil Engineering School of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-BarcelonaTech, Spain. He is director of the “Research Group on Environmental Engineering and Microbiology” (www.gemma.upc). He obtained a degree in biology in 1990 and presented a doctoral dissertation on wastewater treatment engineering in 1996. Joan carries out interdisciplinary research on the development and improvement of environmental biotechnologies that mimicking nature and maximizing eco-efficiency allow treatment of wastewaters and other kinds of wastes. In particular research is currently conducted on systems for wastewater treatment and at the same time materials and energy recovery, like constructed wetlands and microalgae photobioreactors. These biotechnologies are becoming popular in the environmental sector to manage a wide range of polluted waters and wastes like urban and industrial wastewaters, landfill leachate, animal wastes, and sludges of organic origin.</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Selection of cyanobacteria grown in wastewater treatment systems for metabolites production</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. rer nat. Simona SCHWARZ studied photochemistry at the Technische Hochschule Leuna-Merseburg, Germany and sustained the PhD in 1995 at the Institut für Polymerforschung in Dresden, Germany. She is group leader of polyelectrolytes in suspensions at the Leibniz-Institut für Polymerforschung Dresden e.V., Department of Polyelectrolytes and Dispersion.</p>
  <p class="body">Scientific fields of interest: colloid stability, flocculation, solid-liquid separation: polyelectrolytes, biopolymers like starch, chitosan, pectin; adsorption processes and surface modification; multilayers of polyelectrolytes and surfactants; electrokinetic investigations and characterization of solid/liquid interfaces; latices, oxide and pigment dispersions. Current research interest: flocculation and stabilisation of dispersions using polyelectrolytes. Number of papers in refereed journals: about 100, Number of patents: 15.
